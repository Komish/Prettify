# Prettify
Prettify is a Bash helper function designed to be used within scripts to allow for bash colorization of output to the terminal. Running this standalone will provide help text on how to use the function, however the idea is to pull the function out of the script and into your own scripts.

## Potential Changes
- [ ] Add the functionality to output BBCode as opposed to Bash Colorization
- [ ] Add the functionality to output with no colorization at all ("Normalize" color does not do this, but produces a similar effect)
