# Prettify
Prettify is a Bash helper function designed to be used within scripts to allow for bash colorization of output to the terminal. Running this standalone will provide help text on how to use the function, however the idea is to pull the function out of the script and into your own scripts.

## Potential Changes
- [x] [Commit c420f09912eedc0e993d200789588cada7cb62a7] (https://github.com/Komish/Prettify/commit/c420f09912eedc0e993d200789588cada7cb62a7) Add the functionality to output BBCode as opposed to Bash Colorization
- [x] [Commit e8f8a1cf79214d4d2ac5cad3ddda2d91a091653b](https://github.com/Komish/Prettify/commit/e8f8a1cf79214d4d2ac5cad3ddda2d91a091653b) Add the functionality to output with no colorization at all ("Normalize" color does not do this, but produces a similar effect)
